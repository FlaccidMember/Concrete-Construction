Name: Concrete Construction

Version: Pre-Release

This is a mod for Satisfactory that adds many new concrete and asphalt buildables to the game. 
This version is incomplete and is being actively worked on. You're welcome to install this mod manually to your game but keep in mind that shapes currently available in this version might not be available upon release of v1.

If you have any questions, contact me (FishFace) via the Satisfactory modders discord.

This repo contains 2 main folders:
- ConcreteConstruction
- CCFBXFiles

If you just want to install the mod, then just copy "ConcreteConstruction" to your mod folder.

The CCFBXFiles folder, contains all of the FBX files that were made for Concrete Construction, which is about 450 at the time of writing this.

These versions of the FBX files are the ones currently being used in the mod, so if you find any problems I might have overlooked, please let me know so I can fix them in the mod aswell.

I'm sharing the FBX files for anyone that might find them useful in developing their own mod for Satisfactory, whether that be to assist in copying measurements, or to directly import them to UE5 to use directly. 
I have drawn on the experience of alot of people in the Satisfactory modding community, either directly or indirectly via the Docs, to help make this mod, so these FBX files are my way of contributing something back to the community.
